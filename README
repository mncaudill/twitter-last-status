This is an extremely simple piece of Javascript that uses the JSONP interface of Twitter
to pull in the last status of a username.

It is covered under the BSD License.

Usage (an example file is also included):

1) Set the twitter_username variable to the desired user.
2) Include the script on any HTML page.
3) The script looks for a HTML div on the page with id of 'twitter-last-status'
    to fill in after the callback.
